NetEquus — Equestrian-First Horse Simulator

Welcome to NetEquus, a passion project dedicated to creating the most immersive and realistic horse simulator, designed by and for equestrian enthusiasts.
Whether you love breeding, competing, or managing your own stable, NetEquus offers a deep, authentic experience built from the ground up with care and attention to detail.

Here’s how NetEquus stands apart and offers a truly unique experience:

  - No micromanagement — no training schedules or daily horse care chores.

  - A competition system with progression to higher levels and biannual events.

  - Performance-based breeding with simple numeric systems — no complex color genetics.

  - Dynamic horses with temperaments influencing preferences and needs.

  - A rich breeding system allowing horses to take on varied roles.

  - A curated selection of breeds, each chosen with purpose and thought.
